# STRIP-ViTA
This work corroborates a run-time Trojan detection method exploiting STRong Intentional Perturbation of inputs, is a multi-domain Trojan detection defence across Vision, Text and Audio domains---thus termed as STRIP-ViTA. Specifically, STRIP-ViTA is the first confirmed Trojan detection method that is demonstratively independent of both the task domain and model architectures.
